# Research: What's Real in Feb 2026

## What ALREADY EXISTS (don't build these)
- **AI agent marketplaces**: OpenClaw ecosystem (SeekClaw, ClawTasks, Claw Work), 47jobs, Morpheus Network, NEAR AI Agent Market
- **AI agent insurance**: Armilla AI ($25M coverage via Lloyd's), Vouch Insurance, ElevenLabs AIUC-1
- **Carbon tracking**: Climate TRACE (352M+ emission sources), CodeCarbon, GainForest (Solana-based)
- **Deepfake detection**: Multiple products exist
- **Real-time translation**: Multiple products exist
- **Prediction markets**: Polymarket, Manifold

## What JUST launched (bleeding edge, use these)
- **Stripe ACS + Shared Payment Tokens (SPTs)**: Agents initiate scoped payments without exposing credentials
- **Stripe ACP**: Open-source agentic commerce protocol (co-maintained with OpenAI)
- **Coinbase Agentic Wallets + x402**: Purpose-built wallets for AI agents. 50M+ transactions on x402.
- **Solana Alpenglow**: 100-150ms finality (from 12.8s). Live H1 2026.
- **Solana Confidential Balances**: ZK-powered encrypted balances + transfers. Auditor keys for compliance. NO consumer product uses them yet.
- **ElevenLabs Eleven v3**: 70+ languages, multi-speaker dialogue, emotion tags. Text-to-Dialogue API.
- **ElevenLabs Scribe v2 Realtime**: Sub-150ms live transcription.
- **Miro MCP Server**: Just launched. AI agents can read/write boards.
- **Claude Opus 4.6**: 1M token context.
- **OpenAI Frontier**: Enterprise agent management platform.
- **Colosseum AI Agent Hackathon** (ended Feb 12): 21,000 autonomous AI agents launched. Biggest trend.

## HOTTEST DEBATES right now
- **Seedance 2.0**: ByteDance AI video model, Hollywood sending cease-and-desists. Biggest copyright fight.
- **EU AI Act**: Full enforcement Aug 2, 2026 (5 months away). Standards NOT ready. Companies scrambling.
- **Data center energy backlash**: Populist resistance growing. MIT named hyperscale data centers a 2026 breakthrough.
- **State vs Federal AI regulation**: California AI safety law vs Trump executive order.
- **AI liability**: Courts wrestling with AI chatbot harms.

## THE GAPS — What does NOT exist yet

### 1. Carbon-aware AI inference router (COMMERCIAL PRODUCT)
- Research exists (Microsoft EcoServe: 47% carbon reduction, NeurIPS: 40% reduction)
- NO commercial product offers "pick the greenest GPU for this request"
- NO consumer-facing carbon transparency for AI usage

### 2. MCP server for real-time grid carbon
- No MCP exposes WattTime/Electricity Maps data to AI agents
- AI agents CANNOT factor grid carbon into their own decisions yet

### 3. On-chain AI carbon receipts
- Nobody combines blockchain immutability with AI inference carbon measurement
- No "proof of sustainable AI inference" exists

### 4. Solana Confidential Transfers applications
- Production-ready but ZERO consumer-facing products use them
- No confidential carbon credit trading
- No confidential AI inference payments

### 5. Cross-protocol agentic bridge (ACP ↔ x402)
- Stripe ACP (fiat) and Coinbase x402 (crypto) are siloed
- No bridge between fiat and crypto agent payment rails

### 6. Agent-to-agent service marketplace
- Agents can hold wallets now but can't discover/hire/negotiate with each other
- True competitive bidding with reputation-weighted scoring doesn't exist

### 7. EU AI Act compliance tooling for agents
- 5 months to enforcement, standards not ready
- No tools help autonomous AI agents comply with Article 50 (AI content must be detectable)

### 8. Self-offsetting AI agent
- No agent measures own carbon footprint, buys offsets proportionally, proves on-chain

### KEY INSIGHT: "All building blocks exist. Nobody has built the connective tissue."
