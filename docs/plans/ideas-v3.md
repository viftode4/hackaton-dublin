# Ideas v3 — Expert Agent Protocol + Orchestrator

## Core Concept: 3-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Expert Agent Marketplace
- Companies publish domain-expert AI agents (not just APIs) with outcome-based pricing
- "Stripe Expert" that can design your billing architecture for €5, not raw API endpoints
- Key insight: "An API returns data. An expert makes decisions."
- Selling **judgment**, not API calls

### Layer 2: Personal Context Hub
- User's unified data from all tools via MCP
- Calendar, bank, notes, code, history
- GDPR data portability angle

### Layer 3: The Orchestrator
- Natural language → plans → hires expert agents → generates code → deploys
- Also usable as a developer framework/SDK
- Claude as the brain, MCP as the nervous system

## Challenge Stacking (~€31,500+)
Agentic AI (€1k) + Claude ($10k) + Stripe (€3k) + Paid (office+2yr) + Data (€7k) + Solana (€3.5k) + Crusoe ($5k) + Adaptable Agent + Consulting Agent + Miro (€1k) + Lovable (€1k)

## Demo Concept: "The Orchestrator Builds Itself"
- Live: describe a need → orchestrator discovers experts → hires them → generates working app
- Meta-narrative: "We used our own product to build the demo you're watching"

## Three Directions Explored

### Direction A: Expert Agents as the product
- Risk: abstract platform play
- Fix: pick ONE killer vertical for the demo (billing? compliance? dev tooling?)
- Platform is slide 2, not the demo

### Direction B: Self-offsetting angle, Experts as infrastructure
- Product = first carbon-negative AI agent
- Under the hood uses expert agents (carbon, Solana, offset)
- Story = environmental, demo = tangible (live dashboard, real offset, NFT minted on stage)
- Sustainability theme locked

### Direction C: Merge — "The AI that builds green apps" (STRONGEST)
- Prompt "Build me X" → orchestrator hires experts → generates app → makes process carbon-neutral
- Tracks every inference, every agent call, offsets everything, proves on Solana
- Product = development tool. Angle = "Every app built with us is born carbon-neutral"
- Demo-able in 3 min, emotionally resonant, technically deep, commercially viable
- Maximum challenge stacking (~€31k)
