## 1. Security Track
- **Sponsor**: Bluedot Impact (AI safety courses & communities, def/acc philosophy)
- **Prize**: €1,000
- **Goal**: Build a security tool that detects, monitors, or mitigates AI-enabled threats before they scale
- **Philosophy**: Defensive Acceleration (def/acc) — accelerate defensive tech to outpace offensive capabilities
- **Rule**: Must strengthen the defender, not the attacker

### Context
- Even a college student with AI can explore dangerous cyberattack strategies
- Defensive infrastructure (surveillance, cybersecurity) remains outdated and fragmented
