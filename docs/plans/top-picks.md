# HackEurope 2026 — Top Picks (pitch to teammates)

| Theme | Idea | Challenges it hits | Why it wins |
|-------|------|--------------------|-------------|
| Sustainability | **GreenCI: Autonomous Carbon-Aware Code Reviewer**<br>A GitHub agent that estimates energy footprint of PRs using CodeCarbon, queries ElectricityMaps for grid intensity, and suggests cleaner Crusoe infrastructure. | #8 (BearingPoint Consulting Agent), #12 (Crusoe Inference), #9 (Claude API), #7 (incident.io Adaptable Agent) | Hits 5 massive bounties. Solves a real enterprise ESG problem (DORA compliance) and utilizes the exact core sponsors' tech stack in a cohesive way. |
| Sustainability | **GridSync: Green Scheduler & Forecasting Dashboard**<br>A web platform where teams submit ML workloads. It uses ElectricityMaps history to predict the greenest time to run, triggers Crusoe API, and charges via Paid/Stripe based on CO2 saved. | #14 (Susquehanna Data Use), #10 (Stripe), #13 (Paid.ai), #12 (Crusoe API), #4 (Lovable) | Demonstrates complex data forecasting (Susquehanna), features a real monetization strategy (Stripe/Paid), and handles scheduling on clean infra perfectly. |
| Sustainability | **EcoArch: Visual Energy Auditor for Legacy Systems**<br>A Miro MCP server that visualizes a company's Rails backend architecture. An agent monitors real-time CodeCarbon metrics; if energy spikes during peak carbon hours, it visualizes the hotspot and adapts gracefully. | #3 (Miro AI), #11 (Intercom / Rails), #7 (incident.io Adaptable Agent) | Extremely visual (Miro), real-time, adaptable AI behavior. Connects infrastructure diagramming directly with live emissions data. |
| Sustainability | **VeriGreen: On-Chain AI Compute Receipts**<br>A platform for renting clean GPU compute. Exact emissions (tracked by CodeCarbon & ElectricityMaps) are minted as a verifiable "Green Receipt" on the Solana blockchain to prove ESG compliance. | #1 (Solana), #12 (Crusoe Inference) | Brings blockchain verification to ESG reporting (huge narrative). Simple, verifiable, and highly relevant to the Solana ecosystem. |
